# LR Grammar

$LL(1)$ language has good enough properties for us to write a simple parser. However, $LL(1)$ still has too many restrictions and sometimes not expressive enough. An alternative approach would be to use $LR(1)$ grammar, which is left starting, rightmost derivation and look ahead of one symbol. Using $LR(1)$, for any given sequence, we can derivate a leftmost reduction path, thus constructing a parse tree using rightmost derivation.

However, $LR(1)$ is too complex sometimes, we may also use $SLR(1)$, simplified version of $LR(1)$, or $LALR(1)$, which is a combination of $LR(1)$ and $SLR(1)$. We also introduce $LR(0)$.

## LR Parser

LR Parse is a simplified, and in a sense, reversed PDA that has only one state. All CFG can be accepted by a single-node PDA.

:::info

In the last section, when converting from CFG to PDA, we constructed a single node PDA that can accept all CFG.

:::

:::tip

When constructing PDA from CFG, we see that one-state PDA has the same expressive power as multiple-states. This is true with empty-stack-equals-acceptance. For accept state set, we need two states, one for the starting, one for the end, so that we can have the same expressive power.

Two states with accept state set basically have an extra rule that when the stack is empty, go to the accept state.

:::

LR parser is based on deduction. It has four possible actions,

- Move to the next input symbol, and put it into its stack.
- Pop a few elements from the stack, deduce it into a single non-terminal, then put the non-terminal into the stack.
- If there only left start symbol in the stack and the inputs are exhausted, accept.
- The inputs have exhausted but there are more signs in the stack other than the start symbol, and the machine can not do any more deduction, reject.

This basically is a PDA that walks backward from the end. But in another sense, similar to what we learnt back in the left linear grammar, this walking-backward can be converted into a normal PDA by tweaking the rules.

Nonetheless, we will not focus on how LR parser works as a PDA. It's not the focus.

Now, we have only one issue- how can we define which action the parser should take? Accept and reject are easy to judge, but when should a deduction or a move happen?

## Operator Precedence Grammar

OPG is a grammar that, besides what common grammar possesses, it also has a relation of total order, that for any two terminals, $a, b \in \mathcal{V}$, one of, $a \equiv b$, $a \not < b$, or $a \not < b$ exists.

:::tip

$\not <$ is just $\geq$. But it's easier for us to describe and think written as $\not <$. Same for the other symbol. 

:::

We define the order as, (for grammar that doesn't produce $\lambda$),

- $a \equiv b$ if and only if there exists rules like $A \rightarrow \ldots ab \ldots$ or $A \rightarrow \ldots aBb \ldots$.
- $a \not < b$ if and only if there exists $A \rightarrow \ldots aB \ldots$ and $B \Rightarrow^+ b \ldots$ or $B \Rightarrow^+ Cb \ldots$.
- $a \not > b$ if and only if there exists $A \rightarrow \ldots Bb \ldots$ and $B \Rightarrow^+ \ldots a$ or $B \Rightarrow^+ \ldots aC$.

:::tip

A bit hard to understand. This order is actually the order of reduction. If we have,

$$
S \rightarrow Bb \\
B \rightarrow aC \\
C \rightarrow c
$$

For any deduction, the $a$ is guaranteed to disappear into non-terminals after $b$ does, so that $a \not > b$.

For example, consider deducting the string $acb$,

$$
acb \Leftarrow aCb \\
\Leftarrow Bb \\
\Leftarrow S
$$

$a$ always disappear before $b$.

:::

If $a$ and $b$ is never adjacent (ignoring the non-terminals) in any rules, we can assign arbitrary order to them.

If you can define two relations on one pair, then it means that the grammar isn't OPC, you should consider refactoring.

For example, consider the following grammar that yields mathematical expression with only multiplication and addition,

$$
S \rightarrow E \\
E \rightarrow E + E \\
E \rightarrow E * E \\
E \rightarrow (E) \\
E \rightarrow 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
$$

Because of,

$$
E \rightarrow E + E \\
E \rightarrow E * E \\
$$

So $+ \not > *$ and $* \not > +$ is valid at the both time, so, it's not OPC.

However, we can rewrite it into,

$$
S \rightarrow E \\
E \rightarrow E + T | T \\
T \rightarrow T * F | F \\
F â†’ (E) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
$$

Here, $+$ is always reduced after $*$, and thus $* \not > +$ is valid. Thus, it is an OPC.

## Construct Precedence Table

We can't iterate through every rule to get the precedence. Here is a systematic algorithm.

Define the $\text{FIRSTOP}$ and $\text{LASTOP}$ of a non-terminal $A$. The first being all possible terminals that can be the first terminals of all the sentences derivate from $A$, and the latter is the last. To formulate it formally,

$$
\text{FIRSTOP}(A) = \{b | A \Rightarrow^+ b \lor A \Rightarrow^ Bb \quad B \in \mathcal{N}, b \in \mathcal{V} \} \\
\text{LASTOP}(A) = \{b | A \Rightarrow^+ b \lor A \Rightarrow^+ Cb  \quad B \in \mathcal{N}, b \in \mathcal{V}\}
$$
