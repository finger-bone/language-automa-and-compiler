# LR Grammar

$LL(1)$ language has good enough properties for us to write a simple parser. However, $LL(1)$ still has too many restrictions and sometimes not expressive enough. An alternative approach would be to use $LR(1)$ grammar, which is left starting, rightmost derivation and look ahead of one symbol. Using $LR(1)$, for any given sequence, we can derivate a leftmost reduction path, thus constructing a parse tree using rightmost derivation.

However, $LR(1)$ is too complex sometimes, we may also use $SLR(1)$, simplified version of $LR(1)$, or $LALR(1)$, which is a combination of $LR(1)$ and $SLR(1)$. We also introduce $LR(0)$.

## Testing a CFG for $LR$

The first steps include eliminating left recursion
