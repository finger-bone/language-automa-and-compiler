# Language

## Symbol

A symbol is an atomic unit of the language. We usually just use characters starting from $a$ or use numbers.

## Sentence

A sentence is a sequence of symbols. We usually use $s, u, v, w, x, y, z$ as notation for a sentence. That is, for example, $u=aaaa$.

## Language

Language is a set of sentences. Usually noted as $\mathcal{L}$.

## At Operator

We can use $n@w$ to take the $n$ th symbol of sentence $w$, starting from zero. For example,

$$
0@(abc) = a
$$

## Vocabulary

A vocabulary is a set of symbols. Usually noted as $\mathcal{V}$.

## Length of the Sentence

The length of a sentence is how many symbols it has. Noted as $|v|$ for sentence $v$.

## Empty Sentence

An empty sentence is a sentence with no words. It is unique and often noted as $\lambda$, $|\lambda| = 0$.

## Concatenation

The concatenation of two sentences $u$ and $v$ is denoted as $uv$.

$$
n@uv = \begin{cases}
n@u & n < |u| \\
n-|u|@v & n \geq |u|
\end{cases}
$$

## Prefix and Suffix

$s$ is a suffix of $y$ if and only if there exists such $x$ that, $xs=y$.

$s$ is a prefix of $y$ if and only if there exists such $x$ that, $sx=y$.

## Substring

$s$ is a substring of $y$ if and only if there exists such $x$ and $z$ that, $xsz=y$.

## Sentence with Single Symbol

If a sentence has only one symbol, we can use the symbol to denote the sentence. For example, $a$ can be a sentence with one symbol $a$.

## Repeat

If a sentence $u$ is $n$ times concatenation to $v$, then we note, $u = v^n$.

We define, $u^0 = \lambda$.

## Reverse

$w^R$ is the reverse of sentence $w$, where $|w^R| = |w|$, but $i@w^R = (n-j-1)@w$

## Concatenation with Vocabulary

If we concatenate a sentence $w$ to a vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$, it yields a language set.

$$
w\mathcal{V} = \{ ws | s \in \mathcal{V} \}
$$

## Language Concatenation

The concatenation of two language $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ yields a new language, such that every sentence is a concatenation of a sentence in $\mathcal{L}_1$ and a sentence in $\mathcal{L}_2$.

Similarly, if the concatenation happens multiple times, we note it as exponentiation.

## Vocabulary as Language

We define,

$$
\lambda \mathcal{V}
$$

As the corresponding language set of a vocabulary. We still note this language $\mathcal{V}$.

## Closure

The star closure of a language results in all the possible sentence that can be built by concatenation.

That is,

$$
\mathcal{L}^* = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{L}^n
$$

For positive closure, it removes the empty sentence.

$$
\mathcal{L}^+ = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathcal{L}^n
$$
