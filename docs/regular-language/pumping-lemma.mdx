# Pumping Lemma of Regular Languages

The pumping lemma for regular languages is a lemma that describes an essential property of all regular languages. Informally, it says that all sufficiently long strings in a regular language may be pumped—that is, have a middle section of the string repeated an arbitrary number of times—to produce a new string that is also part of the language.

In the following passage, we only talk about infinite languages. For finite language is guaranteed to be regular language.

## Pumping Lemma of Regular Languages and Its Proof

Pumping Lemma states that, if $\mathcal{L}$ is an infinite regular language, there must exists a pumping length $p \geq 1$ ($p$ is only dependent on the language).

If an integer $p$ is a pumping length. For any $w \in \mathcal{L}$ and $|w| \geq p$, there must exists a way of dividing $w$ into,

$$
w = xyz
$$

Where, $|y| \geq 1$ and $|xy| \leq p$.

And $\forall n \geq 0$, $xy^nz \in \mathcal{L}$.

This can be proven with regular expression- and is very simple.

Because $\mathcal{L}$ is infinite, there must exist at least one star, that is,

$$
R = r_1r_2^*r_3
$$

Where $r_2$ is not empty.

Thus, if $x$ matches $r_1$, $z$ matches $r_3$, $y$ matches $r_2$, we will have the pumping lemma.

## Example

We usually use pumping lemma to prove a language is not regular.

For example, we would like to prove,

$$
0^n1^n
$$

Is not a regular language.

We assume there exists a pumping length $p$, and assume that this is a regular language.

Pumping lemma tells us that for every string longer than pumping length, there must exists a pumping decomposition. We can take,

$$
w = 0^p1^p
$$

We know that a pumping decomposition exists, but we don't know exactly how- it's okay, we can assume,

$$
w = xyz
$$

No matter how $w$ decomposes, there are only there cases for $y$.

- $y$ contains only $1$, then obviously, $xy^2z \not \in \mathcal{L}$, because there will be more $1$ than $0$.
- $y$ contains only $0$, then obviously, $xy^2z \not \in \mathcal{L}$, because there will be more $0$ than $1$.
- $y$ contains $0$ and $1$, then $y = 0^{a}1^{b}$, then $xy^2z=0^{n}1^b0^a1^{n} \not \in \mathcal{L}$

Thus, there doesn't exists such a decomposition.

In conclusion, $0^n1^n$ is not a regular language.
